## Appendix: Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions
**Q: How do you handle gas fees?**
A: We use Polygon L2 which has minimal gas fees (pennies per transaction). We also batch transactions to reduce costs.

**Q: What if the blockchain goes down?**
A: We use multiple blockchains (Polygon + Ethereum) and have fallback mechanisms. The platform can continue operating even if one chain has issues.

**Q: How do you ensure data privacy?**
A: We use IPFS for decentralized storage and only store necessary data on-chain. Personal information is encrypted and stored securely.

### Business Questions
**Q: How do you compete with Ticketmaster?**
A: We offer lower fees, better user experience, and unique features like fractional ownership. We're not trying to replace them, but complement the market.

**Q: What's your moat?**
A: First-mover advantage, specialized technology, and network effects. Once users have tickets on our platform, they're likely to stay.

**Q: How do you handle regulation?**
A: We work with legal experts and comply with existing regulations. Our architecture is designed to adapt to changing requirements.

### Financial Questions
**Q: What's your burn rate?**
A: $250K/month currently, decreasing as we scale. We have 18 months of runway with current funding.

**Q: When do you become profitable?**
A: Month 18 with current projections. We're focused on growth over profitability in the short term.

**Q: What's your valuation?**
A: We're seeking $10M at $40M pre-money valuation, based on comparable companies and our growth projections.
